# Peak Navigator: An approach for Image Histogram Local Maxima Extraction

The objective is to efficiently extract local maxima of an imageâ€™s histogram.  After smoothing the histogram with a moving average filter, the data density and distribution are analyzed to find the best location for observation. An observability index is assigned to each initial peak, helping decide if it's significant when using the observed location for evaluation. Recursive algorithms are then developed to find and merge peaks accurately, eliminating false detections on either side of each mode.
